# About
The goal of this project was to recreate a precise clone of Apple's Stocks iOS app. It's displaying real-time stock price data and a basic summary a financial metrics. The customizable watchlist contains the ticker symbols, company names, price and price changes and a small price chart . The app also has a search functionality. By tapping on a ticker it displays the relatable news and a larger price chart with the fundamentals. The UI repliactes Apples design and supports dark and light mode.

# What I learned?
This was one of my first full fledged apps I built and this particular project helped me understand the inner workings of UIKit, how to use collectionViews, TableViews and how to implement the Codable protocol. 
This project was a huge step forwards for me and helped me build apps with confidence with the UIKit framework.
